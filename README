This is the Mwana MNCH RapidSMS project for deployment in Zambia and Malawi.
When development settles down a bit, the rapidsms package can be bundled into
a deb, rpm, .tar.gz (or whatever), and installed into site-packages.

level of the rapidsms tree and run init and update there as well:

cd submodules/rapidsms
git submodule init
git submodule update

3) To create your database and tables, run:

./manage.py syncdb
