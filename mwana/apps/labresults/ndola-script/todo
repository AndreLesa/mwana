- dns servers are unreliable here; configure modem connection to always use google dns (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4)... did we do this?
- locking down internet connection and/or firewall - mess with routing tables?
- handling of non-ascii characters (delegate to receiver end)
  
- call rasdial as retryable task
- since logs are sent first, we can separately log when logs are sync and when everything is synced. this is helpful because if
  anything fails in a single send batch, all logs are resent... even those that got through before the fail
